# ExtraLINQ
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/fn3jf7d0p25eo2rl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kpol/extralinq)

ExtraLINQ is a set of extension methods for `IEnumerable<T>`. Additionally ExtraLINQ contains extension methods for `Array`
 and `List<T>` which are faster and allocate less than LINQ extensions from `System.Linq`.
